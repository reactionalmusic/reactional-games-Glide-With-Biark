# Reactional Games - Glide With Biark

## Version: Unity 6 LTS

Reactional's celebration of the 10th anniversary of Flappy Bird.

### Glide With Biark:
is a demo designed to showcase the capabilities of Reactional Deep Analysis by integrating music with procedural level generation and gameplay elements. The demos purpose is to also show the workflow of how to set up Reactional Deep Analysis Mechanics. This game is similar to Flappy Bird and Geometry Dash, where the player must avoid obstacles while navigating a procedurally generated environment.

### What This Demo Showcases

Procedural Level Generation: The levels in Glide With Biark are generated procedurally, with obstacles moving from right to left while the player remains stationary. Traditionally, levels would need to be fully built, and obstacles manually placed. In this demo, we simplify that process by using procedural generation. With Reactional Deep Analysis, each instrument in the track is used to generate obstacles in real-time, linking player movement with the music. Players need to jump in sync with the song's notes, which generate the obstacles. This creates a reactional mechanic that enhances level building and movement, showcasing how music can drive gameplay.

Juice and Shaders: The game includes flashy shader systems to make the levels visually exciting. Deep Analysis helps create patterns for shader effects, such as blinks and flashes, that are not just tied to the beats but also respond to specific instruments, making the visuals more dynamic. This provides a coherent pattern of auditory feedback linked directly to visual effects, enhancing the overall gameplay experience.

### How This Demo Improves on Geometry Dash
Unlike Geometry Dash, Glide With Biark uses Deep Analysis to procedurally generate elements such as obstacles and shaders, without manually crafting every level, which allows the music to truly drive the gameplay experience.

### Current Setup and Scripts

No Added Mechanics: The current implementation is kept simple to showcase what can be done with Deep Analysis without adding new mechanics. It highlights the procedural generation, the beat-synced movement, and how music can drive gameplay elements.

Feel free to use this setup and scripts in other projects, where you want to use and levrage Reactional Deep Analysis.
