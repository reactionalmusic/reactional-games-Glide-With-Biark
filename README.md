# Reactional Games - Glide With Biark

## Version: Unity 6 LTS

Glide With Biark is a special celebration of the 10th anniversary of Flappy Bird, showcasing the powerful capabilities of Reactional Deep Analysis by integrating music with procedural level generation and gameplay elements.

### ðŸŽ® Overview
Glide With Biark is a music-driven endless runner inspired by games like Flappy Bird and Geometry Dash. Players must navigate through procedurally generated obstacles while staying in sync with the rhythm of the music.

### Key Features

- Procedural Level Generation:

  - Obstacles dynamically generated based on the music's instruments and beats.

  - Eliminates the need for manual level design, allowing music to dictate gameplay.

  - Players must time their movements in sync with the music to overcome challenges.

- Reactive Visual Effects:

  - Flashy shaders and visual effects tied to musical elements.

  - Patterns respond to specific instruments, creating a visually dynamic experience.

  - Deep Analysis enhances both auditory and visual feedback for immersive gameplay.

- Seamless Integration:

  - Reactional Deep Analysis drives gameplay elements directly.

  - Demonstrates how developers can integrate music into procedural mechanics effortlessly.

### ðŸš€ How Glide With Biark Improves on Geometry Dash

Unlike Geometry Dash, Glide With Biark leverages Reactional Deep Analysis to procedurally generate obstacles and visuals in real-time, offering a truly music-driven experience without manual level design.

### ðŸ’» Development Information (WIP)

Minimal Added Mechanics: The current implementation is kept simple to showcase what can be done with Deep Analysis without adding new mechanics. It highlights the procedural generation, the beat-synced movement, and how music can drive gameplay elements.

Feel free to use this setup and scripts in other projects, where you want to use and levrage Reactional Deep Analysis.
